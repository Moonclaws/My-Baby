  Hello Baby 😘<br><br>

  I wanted you to know that you are the most beautiful person in my eyes 😍😍😍
  and the best thing that’s come into my life.
  When you finally became my girlfriend,
  it was the best start to 2026 I could ever ask for!<br><br>

  I love every single moment we share together,
  and I want us to be this way forever 🥰🥰🥰
  We may have our little tampuhan moments sometimes 🥺🥺🥺
  but we always find a way to overcome them
  and come out even stronger.<br><br>

  Making you smile is one of my everyday missions 😋😋😋
  It’s what keeps me going 🤞🤞🤞
  I may say this to you every single day,
  but I need you to know that I really, really love you
  more than words can say 🥰🥰🥰<br><br>

  You make my world feel complete,
  and I can’t wait to make more great times with you 😘😘😘
  I love you very much ganda muah😘<br><br>

  Happy Valentine’s Day 💌🥰
